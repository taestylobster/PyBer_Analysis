# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to provide my boss V. Isualize a multiple-line-graph showing that total weekly fares for each of the 3 city 
types (Rural, Suburban, and Urban) to help visualize the differences so leadership can make decisions based upon the different city types.

## Results
The results of the data analysis can be seen in the graph created below:

As you can see, there is a distinct difference in the amount of fare ($USD) depending on which type of city the driver is located within. There is a much
higher fare for drivers in urban cities, followed by suburban cities, and the lowest fares being in rural cities. We can also determine through the data 
that at the middle of February fares increase for all three city types. Meaning that fares will go up for any driver located in any city. 

## Summary
One aspect the data shows which is interesting is that at the middle of February fares increased for all three city types so I would recommend increasing supply 
during this time period since demand must be high. A second aspect of the data is how Rural cities are the only city type to have their total fare decrease in
the beginning of January, however, it did have a higher jump in the middle of January than the other city types. Because of this, I would recommend not to worry
about that drop in total fares since it will even out in the second half of the month. My last recommendation would be to focus resources on urban cities the most,
followed by suburban cities, and then lastly rural cities. As the data/graph shows, there is a much higher total fare from urban cities over suburban and rural cities.
